# verify-selfhosted-seams.sh — live self-hosted seam verification (deploy#1039).
#
# Covers deploy#1039's acceptance criteria on a running self-hosted cluster:
#   - GET / resolves to the login page (no marketing surface)
#   - the SignupService self-serve path agrees with the deployed signup seam
#   - the operator-seeded first tenant converges and its admin credential exists
#   - docs are served at docs.<domain>, version-matched to the install
#   - www/marketing is not served by this cluster at all (404, no vhost)
#
# A NOTE ON THE SIGNUP CRITERION, because it is not as written
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# deploy#1039 says the self-serve path must return admin-only PermissionDenied.
# That is true only when the front door is closed. ADR-0006 §4 (as amended
# 2026-08-13, deploy#1039) matches the shipped default: self-serve signup is
# ON in both profiles (signupSelfServe: true — GitLab self-managed model),
# and closed registration is the operator override signupSelfServe: false.
# See helm/gibson/values-vanilla.yaml (+ values-eks.yaml on
# EKS) and the assertion at
# helm/gibson/tests/signup-seam.bats ("open card-free signup is the shipped
# OSS default").
#
# The suite therefore reads the deployed SIGNUP_SELF_SERVE value and asserts
# the RPC BEHAVIOUR MATCHES IT in both directions:
#   SIGNUP_SELF_SERVE unset/false -> Signup MUST return PermissionDenied
#   SIGNUP_SELF_SERVE true        -> Signup MUST NOT return PermissionDenied
# Either way the seam is proven coherent — both postures are owner-endorsed,
# so neither direction is hard-coded as "the" correct one.
#
