# shellcheck shell=bash
# coredns-platform-hosts.sh — each bringup gives CoreDNS one record that maps
# the platform's public hosts to the Envoy Service (hosted#397, ADR-0092).
# Sourced, not executed.
#
# WHY
#
# Some in-cluster workloads reach the platform the way an outside client does,
# through the authenticated edge on api.<domain>: plugins, setec sandboxes and
# the e2e runner. Inside the cluster that name must lead to Envoy without a
# trip through public DNS: kind has no public record at all, and on a cloud
# substrate the public answer leaves the cluster and comes back through the
# load balancer, which collapses every in-cluster caller onto one source
# address for rate limits.
#
# The first form of this record (hosted#145) was a `hosts` block that named
# Envoy's pinned ClusterIP. It tied the record to a pinned address, and the
# pin is one of the workarounds ADR-0092 removes. The owner decided on
# 2026-10-05 (hosted#186): the record maps the host to the Service NAME, never
# to an address. So it is a CoreDNS `rewrite`: the question for api.<domain>
# becomes the question for the Service, the kubernetes plugin answers with
# whatever address the Service has today, and `answer auto` puts the asked
# name back in the answer.
#
# The bringup verb owns the record, because the same verb owns the cluster.
# The chart renders nothing for it. This copy lives in zeroroot-ai/charts so
# scripts/baseline-up.sh, the install path of a stranger, writes the same
# record (charts#163). zeroroot-ai/hosted sources the same rule.
#
# Functions:
#   platform_host_rules <service-fqdn> <host>...   pure; prints one rewrite
#       line for each host. Exit 2 when the target is an address or is not a
#       Service name, and when no host is given.
#   corefile_with_platform_hosts <corefile-text> <service-fqdn> <host>...
#       pure; prints the Corefile with the rules inside the `.:53` server
#       block. A block this function wrote before is replaced, never doubled.
#       Exit 2 when the text has no `.:53 {` server.
#   values_domain <values-file>...   the platform domain from the values files
#       in install order, last wins (gibson-workloads.global.domain, then
#       global.domain). Exit 2 when none names one.
#   coredns_publish_platform_hosts <corefile|custom> <service-fqdn> <host>...
#       apply the record and restart CoreDNS. `corefile` rewrites
#       kube-system/coredns (kind, k3d). `custom` writes the
#       kube-system/coredns-custom ConfigMap that k3s imports into its server
#       block (EC2 with k3s).
#
# The record is proven by its effect in the install exit tests: a pod asks
# cluster DNS for the API host and must get the address of the Envoy Service.
