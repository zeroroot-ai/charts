"""wal-continuity.py — is the CNPG WAL archive continuous? (deploy#1738)

Check 2 of scripts/backup-verify.sh, the gate inside a preserve teardown
(ADR-0015, CONTEXT.md § Backup-verify). A base backup with a broken WAL
archive restores only to the instant it was taken, and it looks healthy the
whole time: the Backup CR says `completed`, the objects are in the bucket,
and the hole only surfaces when somebody replays.

A WAL segment file is named timeline(8) + logid(8) + segno(8) in upper-case
hex, optionally with a compression suffix barman appends. With the default
16 MiB segment size the segments of one timeline form the unbroken integer
sequence `logid * 256 + segno`. So continuity is arithmetic: take every
segment on the base backup's timeline, and require no missing index between
the backup's own beginWal and the newest archived segment.

Segments older than the backup are NOT required. The bucket lifecycle rule
expires old objects on its own schedule, and a backup only ever needs the
window from its own start forward.

Usage: wal-continuity.py <aws-s3-ls-output> <beginWal> <endWal>
       beginWal and endWal may be empty; then the oldest archived segment on
       the newest timeline stands in for beginWal.
Exit:  0 continuous, one summary line on stdout
       1 a gap, or nothing archived; the reason on stderr
